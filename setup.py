        Introduced asynchronous versions of `abi_json_to_bin`, `make_transaction`, `get_info` and 
        `push_transaction` methods using aiohttp. This update enhances performance by allowing 
        non-blocking HTTP requests, especially useful for high-latency operations.
        
        Additional Asynchronous part developed by [i-am-Vasya](https://github.com/i-am-Vasya), you can find him on  
        GitHub or email [github@awl.su](mailto:github@awl.su).
